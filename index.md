I am a hard working engineering graduate who is looking for employment within an engineering related industry. Upon my graduation in June 2014, I receive an upper second class honours degree in Mechanical Engineering, awarded by Northumbria University. I am a naturally confident person with excellent communication skills, and I feel I would be a great asset to any company, small or large.
I have particular interests in 3D modelling and rapid prototyping.
